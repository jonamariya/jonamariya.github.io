                <div>In 1880 a group of farmers started their own coffee plantations in northern New South Wales and Far North Queensland. Starting with a bang, this first foray into coffee growing resulted with international recognition, winning awards in Paris and Rome.</div>

<div>But the cost of transportation, high labour costs and the Great Depression crippled our coffee industry. In the 1980s, plantations were once again established with the introduction of the mechanical harvester that significantly cut labour costs. Now we have some incredible coffee beans growing in the Northern Rivers (New South Wales) and the Atherton Tablelands (Queensland).</div>
